- **Unified GPU Preprocessing Engine**
  - Multi-format support (BIDS, NIfTI, DICOM)
  - Real-time motion correction
  - Parallel slice-timing correction
  - GPU-optimized skull stripping and segmentation
  - Fast spatial normalization

- **Distributed Analysis Framework**
  - OpenNeuro dataset integration
  - Smart job scheduling
  - Fault-tolerant processing
  - Cloud-native deployment

- **Real-time Quality Control**
  - GPU-accelerated artifact detection
  - Interactive 3D visualization
  - Automated quality metrics
  - Comprehensive reporting

- **Advanced Analytics**
  - GPU-optimized ICA
  - Parallel connectivity analysis
  - Statistical mapping
  - Machine learning integration

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neuroaccel.git
cd neuroaccel

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For development
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Usage

Basic example of preprocessing a BIDS dataset:

```python
from neuroaccel import Pipeline
from neuroaccel.preprocessing import MotionCorrection, SliceTiming

# Initialize pipeline with GPU settings
pipeline = Pipeline(device='cuda')  # or 'rocm' for AMD GPUs

# Configure preprocessing steps
pipeline.add(MotionCorrection(method='gpu_realign'))
pipeline.add(SliceTiming(parallel=True))

# Run the pipeline
pipeline.run('path/to/bids/dataset')
```
